**Qing Xia** received the B.S. degree from the School of mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University, China in 2019. Now, he is under a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. Dr. [Yibao Li](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/yibaoli) in School of mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University, China. His research interests include Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing), computational fluid dynamics, and scientific computing.

Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in **Shape topology optimization in 3D printing** and **multi-scale multi-physics coupled computation**.  My main work is to project the physical models from real space to digital space for equivalent experiments, which can eliminate the environment and material cost constraints of real physical experiment.
